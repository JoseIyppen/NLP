Given an unbelievably huge amount of data, it is impossible for a user to get insights from such huge volumes of data. Furthermore, a large portion of this data is either redundant or doesn't contain
much useful information. The most efficient way to get access to the most important parts of the data, without having to sift through redundant and insignificant data, is to summarize the data in a way 
that it contains non-redundant and useful information only. This is a simple and short project that achieves the objective of summarizing.
